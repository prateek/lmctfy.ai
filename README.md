git clone https://github.com/prateek/lmctfy.ai.git
cd lmctfy.ai
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser to test locally

3. For development with tests:
```bash
npm install
npm test
```

## Deployment

### Project Structure

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html      # Single-file application
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json    # NPM configuration (dev dependencies only)
â”œâ”€â”€ jest.config.js  # Jest test configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ lmctfy.test.js  # Unit tests
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE         # MIT license
â””â”€â”€ README.md       # This file
```

## How It Works

1. **Generator Mode** (default): Enter a prompt and generate a shareable link
2. **Player Mode** (`?q=<prompt>`): Shows typing animation then redirects to ChatGPT
3. **Preview Mode** (`?q=<prompt>&preview=1`): Shows animation without redirecting
